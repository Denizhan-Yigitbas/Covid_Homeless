# Sheltering the Homeless During a Pandemic

## Introduction

The COVID-19 has caused significant changes in almost every American's daily life. However, one of the populations
that seems to be ignored is the homeless population. However, we fail to realize the impact that this population can
have on the virus' spread. In only San Fransico, out of about 800 known cases in the city, 68 have been reported to be 
amongst the homeless population, almost 10 percent of all cases.  Dr. Katie Brooks from the San Francisco General 
Hospital stated “I am having a really tough time discharging people from the hospital to anywhere but to the street". In order to ease the spread of the virus and 
also care for a population that is need of help, we must find alternate solutions during this pandemic.

To combat this issue, "authorities in Las Vegas needed to find additional sleeping space for the city’s sizable homeless 
population when a 500-bed overnight shelter closed after a client tested positive for the new coronavirus. Officials 
turned a parking lot into a makeshift shelter, saying spaces for sleeping were drawn 6ft apart in observance of federal 
social distancing guidelines."

This action sparked a lot of commentary amongst the general population. Julián Castro, Mayor of San Antonio, tweeted: 
"There are 150K hotel rooms in Vegas going unused right now. How about public-private cooperation (resources) to 
temporarily house them there? And fund permanent housing!"

Castro's tweet sparks up the question if it is possible to house the homeless in the empty rooms caused by the COVID-19. 

This project will work to answer this overarching question:

- Is it feasible to house the entire homeless population in hotel rooms during this pandemic. And if so , how many rooms 
would be needed.

- What would be the cost of sheltering the homeless population in hotel room.


## Data Collection

The two obvious data sets that were going to be needed were hotel data specific to each state and homeless population 
data. The American Hotel & Lodging Association website provided the desired data about hotels. In order to extract these
features a self-made scraper was used to get information on the number of hotels, rooms available, and jobs provided by 
the hotel industry in a specific state. Next, data provided by the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness
was used to extract the data needed for the other half of this project. Although many features detailing the homeless 
population were extracted using another self-made scraper, the main statistic that was used in this project was the total 
homeless population for each state.

Finally, a data set mapping each state to its minimum wage was found in order to perform more accurate estimations
on the economic feasibility this transfer.
